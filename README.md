# 🐦 Birdcall Audio Analysis & Feature Extraction
## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on audio signal processing and feature extraction for birdcall recognition using Python.
It demonstrates how different audio features can be extracted, visualized, and analyzed to distinguish between bird species.

The notebook covers end-to-end audio exploration, starting from raw .wav files to advanced spectral features, making it suitable for machine learning and deep learning pipelines.

# 🧪 Why These Features Matter
Feature	Purpose
Mel Spectrogram	Human-perception-based frequency representation
Chromagram	Harmonic & pitch patterns
Spectral Centroid	Brightness of sound
Spectral Rolloff	Energy distribution across frequencies
Tempo (BPM)	Rhythmic structure (limited but exploratory)


# 🚀 Future Enhancements
